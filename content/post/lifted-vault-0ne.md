**Lifted** is a supers setting. Select humans have been _Lifted_ to become superpowered beings by non-human intelligences for unknown purposes. **Project: OWL** collects intel on these _Lifted_. Watching, learning without ever interfering or being exposed. Now as more Lifted manifestations happen in the public worldwide, **Project: OWL** are the experts and they can no longer sit on the sidelines, and neither can you!

**Lifted** is my love letter to the X-Men, WildCATS, StormWatch, Planetary, and Authority. These are the comics I grew up with and grew old with. I love the underdog struggles, the soap opera drama, one-liners, and the reboots. The superpowered Lifted are the setting's focus. They have the full attention of governments and private industries. How do you track them? Control them? How can they be weaponized?

There is no Professor Xavier or Jacob Marlowe - they are fictional characters. So Lifted, what are YOU gonna do Now?

**Champions Now RPG** is the core system Iâ€™ll use to stat out the **Lifted** universe, you'll need a copy of Champions Now RPG to play. I'll also continue reaching out to other system owners/publishers for permission to include stats in their published works.
