# Origin Story

Champions was the first superhero RPG I ever played, the third RPG ever. I was already into comics, heavy into the X-Men, The Micronauts, anything Secret Wars! Marvel Superheroes RPG (FASERIP) was next, Villians & Vigilantes, Guardians, DC Heroes... Lots of takes and ways to play superheroes. Ron Edwards does a BANG ZOOM job with Champions Now RPG. I was fortunate enough to get to play with him during the early development -he also runs a mean game of Sorcerer!! Champions Now replaces Champions for me. I have run two campaigns so far with it and it's becoming a staple on my heavy run list -like Burning Wheel is! It's still a big dice, crunchy game - but it is a character-driven one.

# Apocalypse Now!

Our first stretch goal is bringing Lifted into the Apocalypse World RPG. It will be very much like the Burned-Over. It's still gritty, and big stakes moves still snowball, plus superpowers. AW: Lifted will play very differently than Champions Now, your stories will be different and I dig that. Apocalypse World blew my noggin wide open the first time I played it. So evocative and visceral. Simple mechanics, yet fictionally heavy. Nuanced, one might even say. My top priorities for AW: Lifted are adding a little more crunch to combat options, push the use of tags in a manageable, gamey way. Add in Hx moves. That's why Paul Beakley is onboard. He brings to the table an eye for the award cycles in games, how mechanics work and support the proposed play(or not), and an interest in pushing to see what else PBTA can do.

The Lifted: AW Hackbook stretch goal will also have online support for Role, Roll20, and other resources on lifteduniverse.com. This stretch goal is available to all backers.

# Next time on Lifted

I'm working on a couple of surprises --waiting on responses... Also mad love to Jason Waters/Hero Games and Vincent Baker of Lumpley Games.

Lifted, I hope, is the start of a rich setting that's easy to hop into and play with. If I have my druthers, there'll even be a Lifted Black-Hack version down the road!!
